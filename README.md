# Final-Version

This code is comprised of each team member's combined individual portions. Note that there are also all the images we use as well as a reference to a button function we sourced from TermSpar et al., these sources are defined in our project report. The final file that contains our submission is titled "stoned_age.cpp". Please download all the images that are in the file in order for the application to function correctly.

# Installation Instructions

Install the zip file and unload its contents in a specific folder (e.g., a folder titled EC327 project). Verify that everything (images, makefile, stoned_age.cpp) has been installed in the correct folder. After, use terminal to change the directory to that specific folder you just created.

# How To Use Application

After changing the directory to your specific folder, run the makefile included in the document. If it does not work, run g++ stoned_age.cpp -o stoned_age -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-network first and then run stoned_age.

# What This Application Features

This app features buttons that allow the user to find out more information about marijuana. The backend of the code consists of all the individual functions for each button as well as all the variables in the int main().
